## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

1. 
  A. The gambler most likely started with a Fair coin.  
  B. The gambler most likely started with a Fair coin. 
  C. The fraction of 100 flips what was with the Biased coin is about 39/100. 
  D. The gambler most likely switched from using a Fair coin to a Biased coin twice.

), split="")[[1]]

stateNames = c("Fair", "Biased")

                   c(0.10, 0.90))

                 c(0.0, 1.0))
